## Introduction
The **VPD Proposal** repository serves as a platform for Value Proposition Design (VPD) for simplying the procedure to develop proposals for Normative's team. It incorporates a simple HTML overlay which structures the types of inputs and discussion you can have with a Generative-AI LLM (such as ChatGPT) with targetted prompts which adhere to the evaluation criteria defined by Normative for what is expected of a *good* proposal.
